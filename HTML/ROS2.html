        <h1>understanding the concept</h1>

            <p>One of the primary ways for nodes to communicate in ROS2 is via topic. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts: </p>

            <h2 class = "idk">Topic</h2>
                <ul id = "topic_list">
                    <li>A topic is a named data channel that nodes use to communicate. Topics are identified by unique names.
                    </li>
                    <li>Data flowing through a topic is accessible to any niode that subscribes to it, allowing multiple nodes to share and receive informationj on the same topics.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 class = "whatever">Message</h2>
                <ul id = "msg">
                    <li>A message is a single unit of data sent over a topic. Each message has a defined structure, known as a message type or msg, which determines the format and types of the data fields it can contain.</li>
                    <li>Examples of message types include "std_msgs/String" or "sensor_msgs/Temperature"</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 class = "c1">Publisher</h2>
                <p>A publisher is a node that sends data to a topic. When a node publishes a message, it writes this data to the topic, making it available for other nodes to read.</p>

            <h2 class = "c2">Subscriber</h2>
                <p>A subscriber is a node that reads the data from a topic. By subscribing to a topic, the node is notified whenever a new message is published, and it can then access and use the data.</p>
